# OpenAPI_Spec-3_TypeScript
This is an UNOFFICIAL document providing the OpenAPI_Spec 3 spec 
in TypeScript. This is for my personal use. You can use it if you'd like,
but know it may be wrong and I am in no way affiliated with OAI. 

You acn see the official documentation at: 
[OAI/OpenAPI_Spec-Specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
